# EDA and Feature Engineering of Google Play Store Dataset

## Problem Statement

The Google Play Store offers over 2.56 million apps, playing a significant role in our daily lives. This project aims to explore the dataset to find the most popular app category, the app with the largest number of installs, the app with the largest size, and more.

## Data Overview

- **Size**: 10,841 rows and 20 columns.
- The dataset contains various attributes about apps available on the Google Play Store.

## Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle duplicates, missing values, and correct data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data and extract key insights.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to enhance analysis.

## Key Insights

- The **Family** category has the most apps (18%), followed by **Games** (11%).
- The **Beauty** category has the fewest apps (less than 1%).

## Internal Assignments

- Identify the category with the most installations.
- Find the top 5 most installed apps in each popular category.
- Determine the number of apps with a perfect rating of 5.

## Getting Started
